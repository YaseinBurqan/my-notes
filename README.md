I have fineshed my degree from Arap Open University.
My specialized is Graphic Design and Multimedia.

### the fundamentals of a good <strong>developer</strong>

Developers who don't fully understand their work tend to develop complex systems.

When faced with the fact that their code will change in the future, some developers attempt to solve the problem by designing a solution so generic that (they believe) it will accommodate to every possible future situation.

Most probably, this time will never come and the code you wrote to solve future problems will increase complexity, make it hard to change the pieces of code and eventually it will become a burden that may destroy your software.

Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future. —  Code Simplicity I see developers who measure their software quality based on code lines.

The software contains hundreds of thousands of lines of code, which means the software they work on is so big.

While you want to avoid having less code, you can easily fall in a trap that will cause you to write a clever code that is hard to understand for others.

The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.

When other developers in your team see that you committed new code to source control, everyone should know that your code is tested, and works.

***Untested code is the code that doesn't work.***
